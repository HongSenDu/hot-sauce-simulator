            "answer": "To better the overall texture",
            "explanation": "Chili pepper seeds are actually NOT spicy, as they do not contain capsaicin. The biggest reason you may want to remove your pepper seeds before cooking with or eating them is TEXTURE. When you are making a pepper sauce, hot sauce, or anything that blends into a thin or creamy texture, you’ll notice the seeds will float throughout your liquid."

            "answer": "Sweet Hot Sauce",
            "explanation": "Since this vinegar is derived from apple cider, it has a sweeter, fruitier taste. It also has an incredibly distinctive flavor (as anyone who’s tried Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar straight-up can attest), while still being softer than white vinegar. Apple cider vinegar pairs best with a sweeter hot sauce. For example, those containing fruit like mango or pineapple."

            "answer": "Makes hot sauce more spicy",
            "explanation": "Fermentation tends to mellow out the heat from chili peppers, so that fermented hot sauces tend to be milder in addition to having more flavor. Unfermented hot sauces tend to be hotter since these sauces have not undergone a fermentation process to mellow out the chili peppers."
